LISP that's, well, visual

## What it be?

It be a collection of assorted VLISP code fragments and related shrapnel collected over 20 years of working with Autodesk products, 2D and 3D design automation, and way too much coffee drinking.  I actually have many, many, many VLISP code files with roughly hundreds of thousands of lines of code laying around, but I just upload small bits when I get bored.
